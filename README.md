X-Drive, remote-controlled robot to resemble Star War's BB8 Droid

During the end of my senior year of High School, I designed a "skeleton" for a spherical, rolling robot that utilized an X-drive drivetrain. The robot goes into an acryllic ball
and includes a spring suspension to maximize the contact between the wheels and the acryllic sphere internal walls. 

I will be publishing an Instructables post to this project soon that includes more of the 3D Models, wiring schematics, and step-by-step guide to making one of your own. For now,
this repo contains the transmitter code (receiver code to be recovered and uploaded. Lost during computer transfer...).
