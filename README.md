# BB8_Droid
X-Drive, remote-controlled robot to resemble Star War's BB8 Droid.

During the end of my senior year of High School, I designed a "skeleton" for a spherical, rolling robot that utilized an X-drive drivetrain. The robot goes into an acryllic ball
and includes a spring suspension to maximize the contact between the wheels and the acryllic sphere internal walls. 

This repo contains the transmitter code. However, I'm still in the process of recovering the receiver code since it was corrupted during a transfer. 

I will be publishing an Instructables post to this project soon that includes more of the 3D Models, wiring schematics, and step-by-step guide to making one of your own. For now, the CAD design, schematic, and some demo videos are uploaded [here]([url](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/195lnOsm_o-LVdRfP2LigSxCPBFzIh-xo?usp=sharing))
